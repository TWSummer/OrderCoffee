##Architecture

OrderCoffee is a single page app built on a Ruby on Rails backend, with a PostgreSQL database, and a React/Redux frontend. To get started with the project navigate to the project directory in the console and run:

`rails db:setup`

This will create the database, and seed it with a little over 500 "orders" that can be viewed. Next, run `rails s` to start the server. Now you can navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser to view the project.
